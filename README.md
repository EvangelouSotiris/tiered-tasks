## Tiered Tasks - Use at https://evangelousotiris.github.io/tiered-tasks/

Simple note taking application with a twist. Created as an experiment with _React.js_.

- For each new task created the user can apply a number of points
- At the completion of each task the points are aggregated as exp points at the top bar
- There is a funny tier system and the app gradually acknowledges the user's task completions by funny quotes at the top bar by level

-> Completed tasks are shown in the archival

-> The tasks are saved locally at the browser's storage and no information leaves the browser

-> Users can clear the storage by the button at the bottom right
